# Grey Stone Message Board

This is a simple message board application built using React to do the following requirements.

Requirements
=======

* Display a list of messages to a user.

*  Allow a user to add messages to the board through a simple textbox and submit
button.

*  When the text is entered it should be reversed and checked for duplicates. For
example, if a user enters “hello world” and hits enter they should see “dlrow olleh”. If a user tries to enter “hello world” again a second time while it is already on screen it should not be added to the store and not be displayed to the user.

*  Allow a user to delete messages.

*  These messages will not persist. So if we refresh the page will go away.

*  Users can also search for specific messages in the message board and also sort all the messages in alphabetical order.
